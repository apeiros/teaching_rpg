RUBY RPG
========

This is a very basic RPG (Role Playing Game). Fork it and have fun with it. Contributions are welcome.


Playing it
----------

Clone or download the project, change into the project directory, then
run `ruby -Ilib bin/ruby_rpg` (note, that's an uppercase i, not a lowercase L in the `-I`).

Your terminal emulation should run at a size of at least 120 columns and 40 rows.



Goal
----

The RPG will have 2 main modes of playing:
* World exploring with top view
* Battle mode in a battle screen
The emphasis is on building your character strategically, and applying good tactics in fights.
Equipment can be bought, looted from enemies and crafted from materials.
Battles are turn based, putting emphasis on tactical fighting instead of button pushing.
For the first incarnation, the story and graphics are of low priority.
