RUBY RPG
========

This is a very basic RPG. There's not much planning yet. Fork it and have fun with it.
Contributions are welcome.



Playing it
----------

Clone or download the project, change into the project directory, then
run `ruby -Ilib bin/ruby_rpg` (note, that's an uppercase i, not a lowercase L in the `-I`).

Your terminal emulation should run at a size of at least 120 columns and 40 rows.
